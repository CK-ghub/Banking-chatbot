- - What is CIBIL?/What is a CIBIL score?
  - Banks, as part of their due diligence process, gauge the creditworthiness of individuals based on credit scores. The information listed on your credit report includes several variables that CIBIL uses to set your credit score. CIBIL score, therefore, reflects the extent of the probability of a default. An individual's credit history is submitted to CIBIL by banks and financial institutions on a monthly basis.
